# BusesAreUs
Android App - School Project


Created an android app for school to parse data from Translink open API in order to show bus stops and routes on a map.
Updates in real time, shows whether buses will be early/on time/late, plots routes using latitudes and longitudes.


Most work is in out/production/BusesAreUs_Phase2 and src/ca/ubc/cs/cpsc210/translink
